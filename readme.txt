The finalmodel4project.ipynb notebook file can be run using the jupyter notebook and it does not work with google colab due to import issues (I have also included finalmodel4project.py)

All the source code related to hardware is located in hardwareside folder.
The latestmodel.tflite file path should be provided in the hardwareside.py file to successfully get the output on the hardware (rasberrypi3)
and labels.txt file path should also be provided in the gg.py file
